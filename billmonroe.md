Monroe was born on his family's farm near Rosine, Kentucky, the youngest of
eight children of James Buchanan "Buck" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe.
His mother and her brother, James Pendleton "Pen" Vandiver, were both
musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home.

Bill was of Scottish and English heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and
Charlie already played the fiddle and guitar, Bill was resigned to playing the
less desirable mandolin. He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove
four of the mandolin's eight strings so he would not play too loudly.

Monroe's mother died when he was ten, and his father died six years later.
Eventually, his brothers and sisters moved away, leaving Monroe to bounce between
uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver,
whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances. This experience
inspired one of Monroe's most famous compositions, "Uncle Pen", recorded in 1950,
and the 1972 album Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen. On that album, Monroe recorded a number
of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver. Vandiver has
been credited with giving Monroe "a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bill's aurally
trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bones."

Also significant in Monroe's musical life was Arnold Shultz, an influential fiddler
and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the blues. In an interview with Ralph Rinzler,
Monroe described the fiddling of Shultz as being infused with more blues than a white
fiddler, although he would play common songs such as "Sally Goodin".
